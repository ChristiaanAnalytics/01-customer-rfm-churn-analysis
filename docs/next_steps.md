# Next Steps — Roadmap to Repo 02: Revenue Trend Forecasting

With a clear understanding of **who the customers are** and **who is likely to churn**,  
the next logical stage is to **forecast JungleCart’s revenue trajectory**.

## Goals for Repo 02
* Build time-series models (e.g. **SARIMAX, Prophet**) to forecast **total revenue and seasonal patterns**.
* Incorporate **churn-adjusted customer counts** from Repo 01 to ensure forecasts reflect the impact of attrition.
* Quantify the effect of macro-economic events (e.g. COVID dip, post-pandemic boom, inflation shocks) on future sales.

## Why This Matters
* Accurate revenue forecasts will inform **inventory planning**, **cash-flow management**, and **marketing budget allocation**.
* By linking churn behaviour to financial forecasts, JungleCart can make **data-driven decisions** about growth targets and operational strategy.

This transition from **customer analytics** to **financial forecasting** mirrors the workflow of a real analytics consultancy and sets up the following repositories in the portfolio pipeline.
